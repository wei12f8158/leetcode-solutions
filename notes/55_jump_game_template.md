## Problem Details
- **Problem Number**: 55
- **Problem Name**: Jump Game
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **URL**: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/
- **Date Solved**: [To be filled]

## Problem Description
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

### Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Related Problems
- Jump Game II (minimum jumps)
- Gas Station (circular reachability)
- Can Place Flowers (similar greedy logic)

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1: [2,3,1,1,4] → true
assert canJump([2,3,1,1,4]) == True

# Test case 2: [3,2,1,0,4] → false
assert canJump([3,2,1,0,4]) == False

# Edge cases
assert canJump([0]) == True  # Single element
assert canJump([1,0]) == True  # Can jump over 0
assert canJump([0,1]) == False  # Stuck at first position
```
