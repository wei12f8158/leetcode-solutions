# Solutions Directory

This directory contains organized solutions to LeetCode problems.

## File Naming Convention
- Format: `{problem_number}_{problem_name}.py`
- Example: `274_h_index.py`, `1_two_sum.py`

## Solution Structure
Each solution file should include:
1. **Header documentation** with problem details
2. **Multiple approaches** (if applicable)
3. **Time and space complexity analysis**
4. **Test cases** with assertions
5. **Alternative implementations** for learning

## Organization Tips
- Sort problems by difficulty within each pattern
- Add comments explaining the key insights
- Include edge cases and gotchas
- Link to related problems for pattern recognition
