```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Choose a Problem**: Browse problems by difficulty in the respective folders
2. **Use Templates**: Copy the appropriate template from `templates/` folder
3. **Solve**: Implement your solution following the naming convention
4. **Document**: Add comments explaining your approach
5. **Track Progress**: Update `progress.md` with your completion status

## 📝 Naming Convention

- **File Format**: `problem-number_problem-name.ext`
- **Example**: `0001_two-sum.py`
- **Folder**: Place in appropriate difficulty folder (easy/medium/hard)

## 🎯 Practice Guidelines

### Problem Categories
- **Arrays & Strings**: Manipulation, searching, sorting
- **Linked Lists**: Traversal, manipulation, cycle detection
- **Trees**: DFS, BFS, traversal algorithms
- **Graphs**: DFS, BFS, shortest path, topological sort
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization problems
- **Backtracking**: Recursive problem solving
- **Sliding Window**: Subarray/substring problems
- **Two Pointers**: Array manipulation techniques

### Solution Template Structure

```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Track your progress in `progress.md`:
- [ ] Problem completed
- [x] Problem completed and optimized
- [🔄] Problem in progress
- [📚] Problem needs review

## 🌟 Best Practices

1. **Read the Problem Carefully**: Understand constraints and edge cases
2. **Think Before Coding**: Plan your approach before implementation
3. **Consider Multiple Solutions**: Try different approaches
4. **Optimize**: Focus on time and space complexity
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Include edge cases in your tests
6. **Document**: Explain complex logic with comments
7. **Review**: Regularly review solved problems
